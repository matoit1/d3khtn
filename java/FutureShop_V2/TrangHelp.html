              <li><strong>Out of Stock:</strong> Will ship when available. This   product is currently out of stock in our warehouse and we have ordered   more from the manufacturer. We are unable to obtain a precise date of   availability from the manufacturer, but we are trying our best to   confirm availability dates. The product will be shipped as soon as the   stock is available. </li>
              <li><strong>Pre-Orders:</strong> This product is scheduled to arrive   in our warehouse on the release date. We make every effort to show the   accurate date provided by our suppliers. If the supplier changes the   release date, we will display the new date with the product details. </li>
              <li><strong>Scheduled Delivery (for 44&quot; and above TVs, appliances and furniture</strong>): Scheduled   Delivery items require scheduling. An email will be sent to you with   your delivery time as soon as we confirm that stock is available. </li>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Please note</strong>: The availability displayed on our   product pages may change while you complete the checkout process, as it   is during this time that our system obtains updated inventory levels for   the product(s) you have selected. The availability displayed on our web   site is only an estimate, and is subject to change. </p>

          <h2> 2. Guide to conducting searches on futureshop</h2>
          <div>
            <p><strong>WebIDTM search</strong></p>
            <p>WebID is the fastest and easiest way to learn more about the products that we carry online. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>On   every flyer, you'll see a WebID next to every product available online.   If there's a specific item that you're interested in, note its WebID.</li>
              <li>On our homepage, click on &quot;Search by WebID&quot;.</li>
              <li>Enter the product WebID from the flyer and instantly learn more about your product.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Basic instructions for keyword search</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Type the item or topic you are looking for into the keyword search box.</li>
              <li>Select the category in which to target your search (e.g. entire site or a specific department).</li>
              <li>(optional)   Under the keyword search box, click on Advanced search, then check the   exact phrase check box if you want us to search only for the words that   you have entered and in the order that you have entered them. </li>
              <li>Click on the &quot;Submit&quot; button; if you are in Advanced search, click on &quot;Search&quot;.<br />
                See more detailed instructions below.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Keyword search</strong></p>
            <p>Keyword   searches are located at the top of most pages. This search allows you   to find information that contains certain words or phrases in various   sections of our site. </p>
            <p>In the event that your search results leave   you with no matches or too many matches, try Advanced Search. With   Advanced Search, you can specify multiple keyword criteria for your   search. The Advanced Search criteria vary depending on the area of the   site (e.g. Music, Computers or Entire Site) you are searching. For   example, in Music, you are able to specify the artist and title, whereas   in Computers, these choices are not available. </p>
            <p>You also can search the entire site. This search will include the product catalogue and the site text, such as HELP.</p>
            <p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Q: Does capitalization matter?</strong><br />
              A:   Only when it comes to the Boolean operators AND and OR. They have to be   capitalized in order to be recognized as Boolean operators. </p>
            <p><strong>Q: What if I don't get the results I wanted?</strong><br />
              A:   Check your spelling. If you didn't misspell your keyword(s), check your   search category and broaden your search to Entire Site. </p>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I enter multiple words?</strong><br />
              A:   Yes. Our search engine will list results containing all of your   keywords first, followed by results that partially match your query. </p>
            <p><strong>Q: Does spelling matter?</strong><br />
              A:   Correctly spelling a word or phrase increases your chances of finding   exactly what you are looking for. In case you are unsure of the spelling   of a word, you can put a wildcard (*) at the end of the word (e.g.   Mendel* will generate results for a search on &quot;Mendellsohn.&quot;) So when it   doubt, let us know. We'll work around it.</p>
            <p><strong>Narrow Your Search Area</strong></p>
            <p>You can refine your search to various sections of the site by modifying the following sections:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>department, e.g. Computers, Music </li>
              <li>category, e.g. under Computers: desktop computers or monitors You also can search the entire site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This search will include the product catalogue and the site text, such as HELP.</p>
            <p><strong>Narrow your search results</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>On the search result page, you can narrow down all results found based on categories, brand, price range and other attributes.</li>
              <li>Number   of items found - The number of items that each search attribute yields   is indicated in (). For example, &quot;Computers (54)&quot; indicates 54 items   were found in Computers that are related to your search keyword.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Sorting</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Based on your search keyword, the search result page can display items according to price, title, or customer rating.</li>

            <br />
            <p>All &quot;Scheduled Delivery&quot; items require delivery because of their size and weight, (for example appliances and large screen TVs).</p>
            <p>How Scheduled Delivery works:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>When   your order is processed, we schedule a delivery date and time* and   email you the details (for store purchases, we’ll schedule this with you   at the time of purchase).  Please allow extra time for delivery during   busy periods as delivery slots fill quickly. We also require delivery of   product in a reasonable timeframe after you have completed your   purchase. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>*Most locations receive a   scheduled delivery: where we cannot schedule a delivery, our carrier   will call you to set up a convenient date and time with you directly.   Some carriers can deliver to your door only: if this applies to you,   we'll make this clear in our scheduling email. </p>
            <ol start="2">
              <li>To   change a delivery, simply call us at the store where you bought the   item. For online orders, there's a link in the original email sent to   you. Just follow the instructions. </li>
              <li>The delivery representative will call you to confirm the delivery and establish a set delivery time window. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here are a few things to expect from the delivery personnel during your delivery: </p>

            <p>• Opening of the box, for   televisions, so you have the opportunity to inspect your product. Please   note that delivery personnel are not able to build stands or other   accessory items.

            <p>• Fully connecting a washer and   dryer to existing outlets (with the exception of gas appliances, or   where carpentry or electrical work is required) including water hookup,   leveling, removal of packing straps, vent connection and testing of   units to ensure proper installation. The dryer must be hooked up with   metal venting, not plastic or foil. <br />
              • Placing the delivery item in the desired location and relocate the old   item to another room of your choice (one for one), assuming there is   unobstructed access. (Relocation at time of delivery is limited to the   confines of your property).</p>
            <p>• Recycling your old item (one for one), if this service has been ordered at time of purchase. Additional charges will apply.</p>
            <p>• Moving your old fridge outside   for disposal. Please note that fridges will not be moved outside unless   the door has already been removed beforehand.</p>
            <p>• Fully connecting a fridge or   range (including putting it in place and leveling) except for connection   of water lines, hard wire fridges or install Tip Kits on ranges.</p>

            <p>• Removing all external packaging   (including cardboard, foam packing and wooden platforms) except for   packaging inside fridges and ranges. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>What to do if you product is not working properly:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>• If your product has arrived damaged, the delivery personnel will discuss your options with you.</p>
            <p>• If your product is not working   as expected within 30 days of purchase, call 1-866-775-2010 and a   technician will be sent to your home at no charge, provided you live   within a 60km radius of a Future Shop store location (otherwise some   remote area restrictions apply).</p>
            <p>Tips to help make your delivery go smoothly: </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>• To avoid any unpleasant   surprises, we recommend that you measure the item’s placement area   beforehand to ensure a perfect fit in your home. Consider measuring the   width of doors, hallways and stairs to avoid any potential obstacles.   Ensure you have removed doors if necessary beforehand if additional   clearance is needed.</p>
            <p>• Please make sure someone 18 years or older is available to accept the delivery during your scheduled delivery time window.  </p>
